# BetterAIMod_1.18.2

![Welcome!](src/main/resources/assets/aimod/icon.PNG)



As much as the name of this project may suggest, this project is less to do with AI and more to add features that me and 
my friends wanted that seemed to be in line with the "vanilla experience". This includes copper as a usable material,
void quartz as a new endgame material, more passive mobs, as well as maybe a new boss following the Ender Dragon?


### Adding Additional Tools:
- Copper Tools & Armor & Nuggets
- Void Quartz Tools, Armor and World Generation

### New Features in World Generation:
- Huge Mushrooms
- Void Quartz Ore 

### Adding New Mobs:
- Capybara
- Owls
- Rats
